### contacts-spring-mvc: tech-spec

## Implemented features:

    # Annotations: 
    
        - ALL classes (? extends Component) are annotated and thereby managed by the Spring IoC container. 
         
    
    # Testing: spring-test: 3.2.0 --> MockMvc
    
        - Enables requests against the Dispatcher servlet
            and thereby "true" simulation of Http Requests/Responses.
            
    # Generic definitions of Controller / Repository to minimize code.
    
        ! NO services exists since the task "prohibited" business logic. 
     
    # Static content:
    
        - References all static content to be available in "compile time"
        
        - Copies all static content to ${basedir}/target/"name of war"/resources
        
    # Modular:
    
        - The spring-mvc project (this)
        
        - The LINKED projects:
            
            - javascriptMVC project (../contacts-jmvc)
